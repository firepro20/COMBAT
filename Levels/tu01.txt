Welcome to Combat!

Let's begin by practicing
some basic tank movement.

	
Use the forward and back
controls to move your tank.


The left and right controls
will turn your tank.


Notice how the tank will lean
with your movements.


Use the fire control to shoot.	


After you kill the enemies,
drive into the EXIT ORB to
complete the level.
