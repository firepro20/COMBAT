Now try some more
advanced movement:
	
Use the emergency brake
to stop quickly.

Use the strafe left/right
controls to move your tank
from side to side.

This will help you to dodge
enemy fire and to make tight turns.		

Use the walls to gain a clear
tactical advantage over the enemy!
	
Make your way to the EXIT ORB
after it appears to continue.
